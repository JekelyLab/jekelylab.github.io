- LLM's pseudo-reasoning is based on correlations

- (40% and 22% respectively for the 10 leading chatbots)
- AI trained to detect COVID-19 from chest x-rays detected only the position of the patient, prone patients were sicker and so more likely to have COVID-19

## Chatbots can lie and conceal motifs


- models can learn to be deceptive
-  MIT researchers identified “wide-ranging instances of AI systems double-crossing opponents, bluffing and pretending to be human”
- e.g. Chat-GPT Pretended to Be Blind and Tricked a Human Into Solving a CAPTCHA 
- learned deception is a source of AI falsehoods (beyond deepfakes etc.)

## Where is this going?

- AI is serving companies that need to maximise profit
- while we are crossing tipping points of planetary boundaries
- technology won't solve environmental problems but will make them worse
- will accelerate what we have (more pollution per year, more mining, more extinction, more CO~2~ etc.) = conversion of the Earth into capital
