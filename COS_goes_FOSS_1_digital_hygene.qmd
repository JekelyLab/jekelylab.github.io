## What is open science?

<br>

- data are shared, indexed, properly archived and discoverable
- same for scientific code
- analyses and workflows to process data are also shared
- reagents (e.g. plasmids), strains (e.g. mutants) shared
- open-source software
- maximise reproducibility
- text + data + code = publication
- publications openly accessible, not behind a paywall
- publishing is affordable and not distorting (not hijacked by corporate for-profit publishers)
- preprints = publication, followed by post-publication peer review

## Workflow Oligopoly

- tools to cover the entire academic workflow
- e.g. Elsevier can now cover the entire workflow
- high risk of vendor lock-in
- preconditions for a functioning market exist, but a common standard is missing

## What is FOSS?

::: columns
:::{.column width=50%}
![](images/FOSS/foss_tree.webp)
::: 
:::{.column width=50%}
- Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
- freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute it freely
- "open source" = accessibility to the source code 
- encourages collaboration and transparency, fostering innovation and community-driven improvement
- 1989: release of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
- four key freedoms: to use, to study, to change, and to share software
- 1991: Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel

## A shift towards FOSS in the EU

![](images/FOSS/FOSS_logo.png){height=4em}

- Microsoft will extend Windows 10 support for another year after all
- however, users will need to subscribe to Microsoft 365
- their data and meta-information will be kept in a US-based datacenter
- when Trump imosed sancions on the International Criminal Court (ICC), ICC's chief prosecutor was reportedly locked out of his Microsoft email accounts
- France's gendarmerie switched to Ubuntu Linux ~10y ago, now 103,000 of their computers run Linux
- Denmark dumped Windows and Office for Linux and LibreOffice
- Schleswig-Holstein is also bidding all Microsoft software adieu
