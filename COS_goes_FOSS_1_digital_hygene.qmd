## What is open science?

<br>

- data, code and text are shared, indexed, properly archived and discoverable
- analyses and workflows to process data are also shared
- reagents (e.g. plasmids), strains (e.g. mutants) shared
- open-source software to maximise reproducibility
- text + data + code = publication
- publications openly accessible, not behind a paywall 
- ideally free to read and publish = Diamond OA
- preprints = publication, followed by post-publication peer review
- evaluations not based on simple metrics
- ...

## Workflow Oligopoly -- Publishing

- tools to cover the entire academic workflow
- e.g. Elsevier can now cover the entire workflow
- high risk of vendor lock-in
- common standard is missing
- re-selling user data (surveillance capitalism)
- about $10 billion/year from public money for science goes to profit

- encourages collaboration and transparency, fostering innovation and community-driven improvement
- 1989: release of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
- four key freedoms: to use, to study, to change, and to share software
- 1991: Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel

## A shift towards FOSS in the EU

- Microsoft will extend Windows 10 support for another year after all
- however, users will need to subscribe to Microsoft 365
- their data and meta-information will be kept in a US-based datacenter
- when Trump imposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC), ICC's chief prosecutor was reportedly locked out of his Microsoft email accounts
- France's gendarmerie switched to Linux ~10 years ago, now 103,000 of their computers run Linux
- Schleswig-Holstein is bidding all Microsoft software adieu
- Denmark alsp dumped Windows and Office for Linux and LibreOffice
- Who is next? HD Uni??

## Learn to use (and build) your computer -- efficiency gains

<br><br>

- let's assume that an academic spends on average 20 h/week at a computer
- this is around 1000 h/year, or over 41 days = ~125 work days
- a 5% increase in efficiency would save 6 working days per year
- a 10% increase 12 days etc.
- taking our FOSS courses (command line tools, FOSS, RStudio paper writing, etc.) is guaranteed to increase efficiency and compatibility
- good return on time investment!
- also good for the openness of your science!



## COS goes FOSS -- lectures and hands-on training

- The command line
- Version control with Git and Codeberg
- The Linux OS, hackathon with your old computers
- Digital hygiene on the internet (trackers, passwd management, browsers, etc.)
- Literature search, Open Maps, Forms, Polls, etc.
- Open science and open publishing
- Structure prediction (AlphaFold, Boltz)
- The Fediverse and taking back control of social media
- Open hardware (Arduino, Raspberry PI)
- Paper writing with RStudio
- The GenAI shove and what to do about it
- ... tbc.
