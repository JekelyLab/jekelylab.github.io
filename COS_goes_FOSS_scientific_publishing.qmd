## Council of the EU

- Council calls for transparent, equitable, and open access to scholarly publications
- not-for-profit, open access and multi-format, with no costs for authors or readers
- encourage Member States to support the pilot programme Open Research Europe (to create a large-scale open access research publishing service)
- use of open-source software and standards

## What is open science?

<br>

- data are shared, indexed, properly archived and discoverable
- same for scientific code
- analyses and workflows to process data are also shared
- reagents (e.g. plasmids), strains (e.g. mutants) shared
- open-source software
- maximise reproducibility
- text + data + code = publication
- publications openly accessible, not behind a paywall
- publishing is affordable and not distorting (not hijacked by corporate for-profit publishers)
- preprints = publication, followed by post-publication peer review

## Why do we need open science?

- Reproducibility crisis
- Only a small fraction of research data is available
- An even smaller fraction of code is available (physicists are notoriously bad in sharing)
- Open access, if exists, is very expensive and maintains the profit of legacy publishers
- Scholarly literature is antiquated, dysfunctional and rewards prestige/hype over quality and integrity
- Scholarly workflows use non-professional, error-prone, closed-source software (MS, Adobe, Prism etc.) that makes sharing, integration, automation and collaboration difficult
- The final product of years of research is often only a single pdf file (1990s tech) behind a paywall
- Data, code and text are not searchable, reuseable, discoverable, shareable

## Most source data collected by scientists are not available

## Impact factor - not a metric of quality

- IF = number of citations to articles in a journal (the numerator), normalized by the number of articles in that journal (the denominator) in the last 2 y
- calculated by Thomson Reuters
- originally created to help librarians identify journals to purchase, not as a measure of the scientific quality of research in an article
- yet, emerged as a pervasive metric of quality
- in some cases not calculated but negotiated (the denominator)
- removing editorials and News-and-Views articles from the denominator (so called “front-matter”) can dramatically alter the resulting IF
- not reproducible, not open (calculated from proprietary data)
- a composite of multiple, highly diverse article types
- comparison of journals not mathematically sound

## We have the solution, but not the balls to implement it

<br>

- under ‘closed’ models, institutions are already spending money on scientific publications 
- transitioning those funds to support diamond open access publication could fully support a global shift to open access publishing 
- at the same time strengthen scholarly infrastructure for code, data, interoperability etc.
- with the potential for cost savings (Schimmer et al. 2015)
- with publishing in the hand of public institutions
- USD 6 billion/year is a lot of money for that
- would also solve most of the problems with predatory publishers

::: columns
:::{.column width=50%}
![](images/open_science/rsos230206f03.jpg)
::: 
:::{.column width=50%}
- plan for a federated scholarly information network
- a system that cannot be taken over by corporations
- designed redundantly
- open standards
- "a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards and open-source norms under the governance of the scholarly community"

## One example for publishing -  Open Research Europe (ORE)

::: columns
:::{.column width=60%}
![](images/open_science/ORE.png)

- open access publishing venue for EC-funded researchers
- no author or reader fees
- Diamond (but authors need to be EC funded)
- maintained by the European Commission
- Wellcome Open Research (https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/) is similar, maintained by the Wellcome Trust
::: 
:::{.column width=30%}
<br>

- open up access methods, results, publications, data, software, materials, tools and peer reviews
- standard tender process held regularly
- no lock-in with a single publisher
- regular procurement processes, no monopoly, fair prices

## Sharing code in an ideal world - federated GitLab servers

<br>

::: columns
:::{.column width=60%}


![](images/open_science/git_on_the_server.png)
::: 
:::{.column width=40%}

- Institutions should host their **GitLab server** for code
- (**GitLab** is a database-backed web application running *git*)
- (*git* is a Distributed Version Control Systems)
- servers should be federated
- European (-> world-wide) network of research/education institutions and libraries
- code shared upon publication in a permanent repo with DOI

## Summary

::: columns
:::{.column width=40%}

::: 
:::{.column width=60%}

- open science is key for reproducibility, scientific progress, integrity, global fairness, resilience, cost-cutting
- solutions exist and are scaleable
- money could come by scaling back payment to legacy publishers
- problems: inertia, lack of coordination, lack of understanding the landscape, political and corporate takeover, prestige and other incentives to maintain status quo
